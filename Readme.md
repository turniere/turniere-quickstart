# turnie.re Quick start guide

To get the current stable version of the turnie.re website running on your machine you don't need anything more than this repository. We preconfigured a docker-compose file with all the containers you will need to run, so everything you have to do is run `docker-compose up` within this directory and everything will be set up by the docker daemon in a few seconds.

To install Docker on your machine just use the package manager of your choice or if it doesn't have a docker package you can look [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/). For [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) or [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) please refer to the official install Guide from Docker Inc.

## TL;DR
```
$ git clone https://github.com/turniere/turniere-quickstart
$ cd turniere-quickstart
$ docker-compose up
```
